*Real-Time Translator*

The Real-Time Translator Web App is designed to break language barriers by translating spoken words instantly across multiple languages. 

The core functionalities of this project include:

1. Converting spoken input into text using speech-to-text (STT) models.
2. Converting translated text back into natural-sounding speech using text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis.
3. Providing an intuitive and responsive web interface for real-time communication.
